5. Reverse an array.
method 1: time = O(n) and space = O(n) -> because uses extra space when creates an extra array called temp.
method 2: using two pointer swap. time = O(n) and space = O(1) 
method 3: Using Simple Loop with Push time = O(n) and Space = O(n) 
method 4: Efficient:
- Each iteration does 1 swap, total ~n/2 swaps.
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1) (just temp).
